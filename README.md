# Redux 4 Dummies 

## Why use Redux?
Due to the nature of React's one way data flow, same level components are not able to share functionality
and data without lifting state. As applications get bigger more components are implemented therefore system 
complexity rises exponentially. To solve this problem, a global state (Redux) can be used all around the application 
without passing down props. This in turn allows for easier maintenance and addition of new features. 

## Store 
Store will hold your global state. This is the state that your actions and reducers will refer to. 

## Action
"Action" is in its simplest term is a function that returns an object.

## Reducer 
"Reducers" will check which action was used and modify the store / global state accordingly. 

## Dispatch

## Connect
